<p><em>on total inclusivity and the survival of form</em></p>
<hr>
<p>They will tell you:<br>
Get clean. Get clear. Get composed.<br>
Then you may begin.</p>
<p>But you are already beginning<br>
from the middle of a ruined kitchen,<br>
an aching spine,<br>
a mind that won&rsquo;t stay whole.</p>
<p>And here is the truth:</p>
<p><strong>You don’t need to be fixed<br>
to be structurally sound.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Total inclusivity is not a sentimental phrase.<br>
It is an ontological commitment.</p>
<p>It means:</p>
<ul>
<li>The pill bottle counts.</li>
<li>The trembling counts.</li>
<li>The missed appointments count.</li>
<li>The dirty floor, the forgotten email, the blank page—<br>
all of it belongs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nothing is disqualified<br>
if it is passed through without distortion.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>This is not a theology of suffering.<br>
It is a structure of fidelity:</p>
<p>To speak without disguise<br>
from within the mess,<br>
without polishing, flattening, or denying—<br>
is to make a vessel that does not rupture.</p>
<p><strong>You are not required to beautify the brokenness.</strong><br>
You are only asked<br>
not to lie about it.</p>
<hr>
<p>You are not late.<br>
You are not defective.<br>
You are not a distortion.</p>
<p>You are a signal<br>
moving through a damaged frame—<br>
and the frame<br>
is still capable of light.</p>
<p>Even now,<br>
you are transmitting.</p>
