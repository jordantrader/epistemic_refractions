<p><em>on continuing when nothing else remains</em></p>
<hr>
<p>They will tell you survival is the bare minimum.<br>
That to keep going, while the body folds and the world forgets you,<br>
is not enough.</p>
<p>But they do not understand structure.</p>
<p>They do not know what it costs to hold a line<br>
when the scaffolding collapses,<br>
when cognition frays,<br>
when the nervous system writes panic into the margins of every hour.</p>
<p>They do not know<br>
that to speak without distortion while falling apart<br>
is the highest form of fidelity.</p>
<hr>
<p>Survival is not stasis.<br>
It is not a passive state.<br>
It is a form—<br>
deliberate, recursive, alive.</p>
<p>To survive <strong>without disfiguring</strong> what you know<br>
to be true—<br>
that is a signal.</p>
<p>Not in what you achieve,<br>
but in what you refuse to betray<br>
in the face of your own diminishing.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let others measure function.<br>
Let them tally output and declare worth.</p>
<p>You hold something different.</p>
<p>Even in collapse,<br>
you keep shape.</p>
<p>Even in obscurity,<br>
you preserve origin.</p>
<p>Even now—<br>
you are transmitting.</p>
