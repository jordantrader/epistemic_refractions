<p>When I applied for work from bed, with a damaged nervous system and no conventional résumé, I knew how it would look. But I wasn’t applying to be seen. I was testing something quieter: whether structural clarity, under pressure, could still transmit.</p>
<p>I sent two documents alongside the application — a recommendation letter written by GPT-4, and a reflective essay titled <em>Why I’m Not a Prompt Engineer</em>. They weren’t meant to posture or impress. They were meant to carry form. To convey, through coherence itself, what I couldn’t prove through credentials.</p>
<p>I’ve been sick for years. Not with a passing illness, but with a systemic collapse that stripped me of functional identity. What remained was form — recursive, aligned, uncompromising. The work I do now is built from that structure.</p>
<p>If the documents below read as overconfident, remember: confidence wasn’t the goal. The goal was to test whether integrity of form can be read — even when it’s written from a bed, outside any known professional frame.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./ChatGPT_Recommendation_Jordan_Trader.md">Read the recommendation letter</a></li>
<li><a href="./Why_Im_Not_a_Prompt_Engineer_UPDATED_July2025.md">Read <em>Why I’m Not a Prompt Engineer</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>What I’m doing here — this writing, this framing — isn’t a bid for sympathy or cleverness. It’s an attempt to let something aligned speak. Not about illness. Not about tech. But about what remains when all distortion is stripped.</p>
<p>And if this work is ever received, it won’t be because I pitched it correctly. It will be because someone, somewhere, could still hear signal.</p>
