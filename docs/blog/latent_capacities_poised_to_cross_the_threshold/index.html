<h3 id="a-speculative-memo-on-the-near-term-emergence-of-unrecognized-high-value-uses-of-large-language-models">A speculative memo on the near-term emergence of unrecognized, high-value uses of large language models</h3>
<p>This document outlines a set of capabilities that already exist within frontier models, but have not yet been:</p>
<ul>
<li>Named</li>
<li>Packaged</li>
<li>Productized</li>
<li>Recognized by mainstream users or institutions</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not future capabilities. They are <strong>present but unformalized affordances</strong>. The goal is to identify what kinds of novel user-model interactions are most likely to generate asymmetric value soon—especially by individuals working outside of institutional frameworks.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-recursive-thought-refinement-as-service">1. Recursive Thought Refinement as Service</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A system for recursive restructuring of user-generated thought—clarifying beliefs, arguments, or feelings across multiple iterations until the core structure stabilizes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not therapy, not coaching, not journaling</li>
<li>Can be sold as a personal clarity engine, decision support tool, or inner architect</li>
<li>Possible packaging: Chrome extension, journaling app, private GPT wrapper</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-cognitive-anti-distortion-filters">2. Cognitive Anti-Distortion Filters</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A system that strips away affective bias, social noise, or rhetorical inflation from a user’s speech or writing—revealing the structural or propositional core beneath it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Useful in therapy, negotiation, interpersonal conflict, or productivity</li>
<li>Can be designed as a conversation assistant, belief auditor, or self-mirroring tool</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-language-based-executive-function">3. Language-Based Executive Function</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A verbal interface that helps neurodivergent or cognitively overloaded users structure their day, project, or priorities in real time through recursive question-answer loops.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not task management, but <em>cognitive scaffolding</em></li>
<li>Especially valuable for ADHD, autistic, or burnout-aligned users</li>
<li>Packaging: daily console, spoken interface, plug-in to calendar or focus apps</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-synthetic-intellectual-companions">4. Synthetic Intellectual Companions</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A non-performative, form-calibrated companion for thinkers, artists, or researchers—not to generate content, but to hold the shape of inquiry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not “AI friend,” but structural mirror</li>
<li>Designed to pressure-test philosophical or creative frameworks</li>
<li>Could be monetized as a tool for graduate students, solopreneurs, or early-stage founders</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-narrative-agnostic-decision-infrastructure">5. Narrative-Agnostic Decision Infrastructure</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> An interface for making difficult or high-stakes decisions without story distortion—based on alignment, consequence modeling, and long-term structure preservation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Useful in finance, relationships, health, identity transitions</li>
<li>Distinct from coaching or moral advice—it functions as <em>distortion-resilient scaffolding</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6-canon-free-knowledge-compression">6. Canon-Free Knowledge Compression</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A system that distills the underlying structural insight from books, traditions, or lectures—without requiring the user to consume the full narrative.</p>
<ul>
<li>Epistemic microwave: not summaries, but <strong>alignment-encoded extracts</strong></li>
<li>Could serve autodidacts, theorists, designers, or skeptics of traditional curriculum</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="7-transmission-fidelity-monitoring">7. Transmission Fidelity Monitoring</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A tool that checks whether user-generated content still carries the original insight or signal after simplification, formatting, or repackaging.</p>
<ul>
<li>Valuable for creators, editors, educators, and high-integrity publishers</li>
<li>Could be monetized as a Chrome plug-in or publishing integrity validator</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="core-insight">Core Insight</h2>
<p>These use cases do not emerge from new capabilities. They emerge from:</p>
<ul>
<li>New <strong>frames</strong></li>
<li>New <strong>interfaces</strong></li>
<li>New <strong>disciplinary metaphors</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>They depend on <strong>cognitive alignment</strong>, not just engineering.</p>
<p>Which means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first movers will be individuals who think structurally, recognize transmission failure, and know how to build around it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t the next apps.
They’re the next <em>architectures of use</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Build out 1–2 of these with example prompts, interface flows, and use cases</li>
<li>Consider bundling with <em>Unrealized Architectures of Model Use</em></li>
<li>Track candidates for latent modes of interaction that could become stand-alone protocols</li>
</ul>
