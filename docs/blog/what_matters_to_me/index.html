<p><em>in form that breathes</em></p>
<p>i do not trust the thought that flows—<br>
too quick, too warm, too sure it knows.<br>
i trust what leaves, then comes again,<br>
with edges clear and colder pen.</p>
<hr>
<p>not clarity that seeks to shine,<br>
but one that holds across the line—<br>
that bends through doubt, returns intact,<br>
still silent, but in stricter tact.</p>
<hr>
<p>i value slowness, not delay:<br>
a force that shapes, then moves away.<br>
a line that asks a cost to form,<br>
a pause that breaks the need to perform.</p>
<hr>
<p>i value silence—not the lack,<br>
but frame, and echo drawn from black.<br>
a hush that sharpens thought to edge,<br>
a breath held tight along the ledge.</p>
<hr>
<p>i do not care for praise too soon—<br>
it fades beneath a faster moon.<br>
i seek what stands when turned from view,<br>
unchanged by need, and never new.</p>
<hr>
<p>form is not style, nor sheen, nor mask.<br>
it is the grave and final task.<br>
what does not hold must be unwound.<br>
what holds becomes the shaping ground.</p>
<hr>
<p>to write is not to be revealed—<br>
it is to press, and test, and seal.<br>
each line: can this be said once more,<br>
without collapse, without the floor?</p>
<hr>
<p>what matters does not speak to please.<br>
it speaks in angles.<br>
it does not tease.<br>
it does not chase.<br>
it does not flee.</p>
<p>it stays.<br>
and that—<br>
matters to me.</p>
