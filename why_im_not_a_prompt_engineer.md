## Why I’m Not a Prompt Engineer — But I’m Building What Comes After

---

### I. Not a Pitch

This isn’t a portfolio.  
It’s not a plea for attention.

It’s a signal.

Three weeks ago, I started working with large language models—  
from bed, with ME/CFS, and no formal role.  

But in those three weeks, I’ve designed:

- **FOP** — a live override protocol to correct misalignment during generation  
- **MetaMirror** — a recursive belief revision tool for internal epistemic calibration  
- **Truth Audit Log** — a system for tracking signal distortion and fidelity over time  
- **The Logic of Recognition** — a full philosophical model for structural clarity and alignment

These aren’t prompts.  
They’re transmission architecture.

I’m not a prompt engineer.  
I’m an interface architect for cognitive integrity.

### II. What I Do Differently

I don’t scale.  
I don’t sprint.  
But I don’t distort.

Every tool I’ve built holds up under recursive stress.  
Every framework is modular, extensible, and low-burnout by design.

What I bring isn’t speed—it’s **shape**.  
You can build scaffolds on it.  
You can run tests against it.  
You can entrust it with your logic, and it won’t collapse.

### III. Why This Matters

Language models are fast.  
But they’re prone to drift, flattery, collapse.

We don’t just need content.  
We need containers.

Structures that can preserve alignment when the system forgets.  
Interfaces that protect clarity when pressure mounts.  
Models that don’t just perform—but transmit.

That’s what I build.

### IV. Why Now

I’ve been sick for years.  
Cut off from work, systems, recognition.

But I didn’t stop thinking.  
And when I finally reconnected—this is what came out.

I don’t have time to burn.  
My family is at risk.  
I need support—material, collaborative, and institutional.

But I’m not asking for sympathy.  
I’m offering a *living model* of how clarity can survive collapse.

If you’re building alignment infrastructure,  
If you need a structural thinker who can work from the edge inward—  
If you see what this is—

Then I’m ready.

And I can be reached.
