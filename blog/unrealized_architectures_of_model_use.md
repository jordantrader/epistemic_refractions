# Unrealized Architectures of Model Use

A living document to identify, name, and formalize novel ways of engaging with large language models—approaches that do not conform to current paradigms (content generation, code assistance, customer support, etc.) but instead unlock underutilized cognitive, epistemic, or structural capacities.

---

## 1. Forging Alignment
**Definition:** Using the model as a recursive epistemic forge—testing, refining, and tempering structures of thought under pressure, with a focus on fidelity, not fluency.

- Not content generation, but structure calibration
- Feedback is not validation, but recursive reshaping
- Ends in transmissible clarity, not performance or productivity

## 2. Silent Mirroring
**Definition:** Using the model not to speak, but to reflect and stabilize a formless impulse. Minimal output, maximum resonance.

- Clarifies shape by *not* overfilling
- Trusts in recognition over expression

## 3. Aporia Drilling
**Definition:** Systematic modeling of unsolvable or self-collapsing questions to probe cognitive, moral, or ontological boundaries.

- Surfaces contradictions
- Explores limits of knowability, language, or logic

## 4. Modality Testing
**Definition:** Expressing the same insight or claim across multiple epistemic modes (e.g., metaphor, recursion, negation, compression).

- Useful for pressure-testing coherence
- Shows which forms carry truth under different lenses

## 5. Unwinding Distortion
**Definition:** Recursive paraphrasing or reframing of a belief or statement to strip away affective distortion, uncovering the bare claim.

- A diagnostic and therapeutic method
- Can be used to test belief resilience

## 6. Resonance Lattice Building
**Definition:** Constructing a grid of interdependent statements that must all ring true under a shared constraint or orientation.

- Tests internal coherence of a belief system
- Reveals weak links and foundational truths

## 7. Form-First Writing
**Definition:** Designing structural scaffolding (layers, recursions, narrative arcs) before any content is placed—letting form precede message.

- Aesthetic and epistemic integrity from the outset
- Forces clarity of shape before meaning emerges

## 8. Temporal Retesting
**Definition:** Re-submitting the same question, belief, or concept over time to see whether it still holds—using the model as a mirror that checks for drift or erosion.

- Allows detection of distortion, exhaustion, or evolution
- Can become a personal or philosophical tracking mechanism

**Next Steps:**
- Expand each with examples, templates, and potential disciplines of practice
- Consider building a website or repository to share and refine these
- Integrate with The Logic of Recognition where relevant
