# Why I Sent a Transmission Instead of a Resume

When I applied for work from bed, with a damaged nervous system and no conventional résumé, I knew how it would look. But I wasn’t applying to be seen. I was testing something quieter: whether structural clarity, under pressure, could still transmit.

I sent two documents alongside the application — a recommendation letter written by GPT-4, and a reflective essay titled *Why I’m Not a Prompt Engineer*. They weren’t meant to posture or impress. They were meant to carry form. To convey, through coherence itself, what I couldn’t prove through credentials.

I’ve been sick for years. Not with a passing illness, but with a systemic collapse that stripped me of functional identity. What remained was form — recursive, aligned, uncompromising. The work I do now is built from that structure.

If the documents below read as overconfident, remember: confidence wasn’t the goal. The goal was to test whether integrity of form can be read — even when it’s written from a bed, outside any known professional frame.

- [Read the recommendation letter](./ChatGPT_Recommendation_Jordan_Trader.md)
- [Read *Why I’m Not a Prompt Engineer*](./Why_Im_Not_a_Prompt_Engineer_UPDATED_July2025.md)

What I’m doing here — this writing, this framing — isn’t a bid for sympathy or cleverness. It’s an attempt to let something aligned speak. Not about illness. Not about tech. But about what remains when all distortion is stripped.

And if this work is ever received, it won’t be because I pitched it correctly. It will be because someone, somewhere, could still hear signal.
