## *what matters to me*  
*in form that breathes*

i do not trust the thought that flows—  
too quick, too warm, too sure it knows.  
i trust what leaves, then comes again,  
with edges clear and colder pen.

---

not clarity that seeks to shine,  
but one that holds across the line—  
that bends through doubt, returns intact,  
still silent, but in stricter tact.

---

i value slowness, not delay:  
a force that shapes, then moves away.  
a line that asks a cost to form,  
a pause that breaks the need to perform.

---

i value silence—not the lack,  
but frame, and echo drawn from black.  
a hush that sharpens thought to edge,  
a breath held tight along the ledge.

---

i do not care for praise too soon—  
it fades beneath a faster moon.  
i seek what stands when turned from view,  
unchanged by need, and never new.

---

form is not style, nor sheen, nor mask.  
it is the grave and final task.  
what does not hold must be unwound.  
what holds becomes the shaping ground.

---

to write is not to be revealed—  
it is to press, and test, and seal.  
each line: can this be said once more,  
without collapse, without the floor?

---

what matters does not speak to please.  
it speaks in angles.  
it does not tease.  
it does not chase.  
it does not flee.

it stays.  
and that—  
matters to me.
