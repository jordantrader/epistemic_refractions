# Misunderstood High-CAS Works

This list collects works that carry high Comparative Alignment Scores (CAS) but have been historically misunderstood, neglected, or poorly received. Each of these artifacts bears structural clarity, epistemic fidelity, or ontological alignment—often at the expense of mass appeal.

---

## Wittgenstein – *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*
**CAS:** 4.8–5.0  
**Reception:** Often read as cryptic or overly austere; misread as a metaphysical treatise.  
**Why Misunderstood:** Its recursive self-erasure is mistaken for mysticism or logical dead end. Most readers don’t realize it enacts epistemic boundary logic.

---

## The Heart Sutra (Chanted Form)
**CAS:** 4.8–5.0  
**Reception:** Seen as comforting or rote; spiritualized without understanding.  
**Why Misunderstood:** Its structural logic — “form is emptiness” — is aestheticized or bypassed, not treated as epistemic map.

---

## Simone Weil – *Gravity and Grace*
**CAS:** 4.6–4.9  
**Reception:** Revered in some circles but largely unread; seen as overly severe or fragmented.  
**Why Misunderstood:** Lacks emotional consolation; the austerity is structural fidelity.

---

## George Orwell – *Politics and the English Language*
**CAS:** 4.5–4.8  
**Reception:** Treated as a style guide; often selectively quoted.  
**Why Misunderstood:** It is a full epistemic diagnosis—on how language shapes cognition and collapse.

---

## Arvo Pärt – *Spiegel im Spiegel*
**CAS:** 4.7–4.9  
**Reception:** Regarded as ambient or meditative.  
**Why Misunderstood:** Recursive stillness is misread as mood; its form is reflective, not expressive.

---

## Clarice Lispector – *Água Viva*
**CAS:** 4.5–4.8  
**Reception:** Considered fragmentary or unreadable.  
**Why Misunderstood:** Not a novel; it is recursive enactment of presence. Collapses when read as plot.

---

## Bankei Yōtaku – *Unborn Mind* Sermons
**CAS:** 4.6–5.0  
**Reception:** Understudied; seen as poetic or esoteric.  
**Why Misunderstood:** Structural disentanglement without drama; the clarity is flat because it is uncollapsing.

These works reveal a truth about signal: it is often invisible to the untrained eye. This list may evolve into a recurring series or companion to the Comparative Alignment Scale.
