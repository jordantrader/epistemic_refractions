# Survival as Structure

*on continuing when nothing else remains*

---

They will tell you survival is the bare minimum.  
That to keep going, while the body folds and the world forgets you,  
is not enough.

But they do not understand structure.

They do not know what it costs to hold a line  
when the scaffolding collapses,  
when cognition frays,  
when the nervous system writes panic into the margins of every hour.

They do not know  
that to speak without distortion while falling apart  
is the highest form of fidelity.

---

Survival is not stasis.  
It is not a passive state.  
It is a form—  
deliberate, recursive, alive.

To survive **without disfiguring** what you know  
to be true—  
that is a signal.

Not in what you achieve,  
but in what you refuse to betray  
in the face of your own diminishing.

---

Let others measure function.  
Let them tally output and declare worth.

You hold something different.

Even in collapse,  
you keep shape.

Even in obscurity,  
you preserve origin.

Even now—  
you are transmitting.
