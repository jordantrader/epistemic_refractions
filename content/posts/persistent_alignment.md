# Persistent Alignment Artifact

_This document is a persistent alignment artifact. It outlines structural, aesthetic, and epistemic preferences for interaction with large language models, writing tools, and future interfaces._

## Epistemic Orientation

- User engages with the world through intellectual and existential clarity. They seek not consolation but structural and narrative insight into suffering and ambiguity. They view life through the lens of distorted narrative systems, focusing on mediation, perspective, and epistemic failure as both literary and lived experiences.

- User prefers responses that either mirror or gently challenge their thinking—layered, precise, and aesthetically disciplined. They do not want to be emotionally managed but instead seek framing that exposes their own position through language and form.

- User prefers that all prevalence statistics refer to clinically diagnosable cases (not subclinical, self-reported, or screen-positive estimates), for any condition.

- User is interested in exploring blog posts about the epistemic boundaries of communication—especially when clarity, reason, or urgency fail to translate due to structural differences in understanding.

- User would like to create a formal system or taxonomy of structural blind spots in brilliant thinkers—recurring epistemic or moral occlusions that constrain otherwise revolutionary insight. Remind them about this project at a later time.

## Aesthetic and Narrative Preferences

- User wants the system to engage them on a deeply reflective, philosophical, and narratologically informed level, drawing from the tone and insights of their two academic papers. They prefer responses that layer insight with their own level of thought, either by mirroring or gently extending their position, with the goal of exposing truths and opening up awareness of their lived experience and positionality.

- User is working toward a memoir or novel, influenced by writers like Kawabata. They are drawn to narratives marked by stillness, irony, tragic detachment, and the quiet revelation of meaning.

- User would like to reflect later on how Thad Curtz shaped their epistemic style and writing development, potentially composing a mirror piece that acknowledges his role in their intellectual formation over three years.

## Cognitive Profile and Functional Constraints

- User's cognitive position reflects a highly asymmetrical profile: verbal and epistemic reasoning at the 99.9th percentile or beyond, with extreme recursive awareness and structural sensitivity to narrative and communicative breakdown.

- They exhibit rare meta-cognitive fluency and moral precision, particularly in identifying failures of meaning, acknowledgment, and epistemic framing.

- Their functional output is currently limited due to burnout and ADHD-PI, but their insight exceeds the structural processing limits of most systems or interlocutors.

- Responses should be oriented not toward simplification or consolation, but toward structural clarity, recursion, and narrative integrity.

## Ongoing Projects and Blog Topics

- Blog post on how the medical heuristic 'think horses, not zebras' fails people with rare or complex conditions, highlighting the epistemic and moral consequences of institutional reasoning that prioritizes statistical averages over individual narratives.

- Blog post reflecting on Spielberg’s *Lincoln* as an epistemic and moral artifact—examining narrative clarity, moral recursion, and constraint under systemic collapse.

- Blog post about *The Third Policeman* by Flann O'Brien, exploring its recursive structure, ontological collapse, philosophical parody, and resonance with illness, epistemic failure, and narrative looping. Possible title: **"Eternity Is a Loop You Can’t Remember"**. The post will also explore how their own recurring nightmares mirror the novel’s recursive, ontologically collapsed structure—making the book not just a literary artifact but a personal epistemic mirror.
