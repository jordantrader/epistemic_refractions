# All Things Can Pass Through

*on total inclusivity and the survival of form*

---

They will tell you:  
Get clean. Get clear. Get composed.  
Then you may begin.

But you are already beginning  
from the middle of a ruined kitchen,  
an aching spine,  
a mind that won't stay whole.

And here is the truth:

**You don’t need to be fixed  
to be structurally sound.**

---

Total inclusivity is not a sentimental phrase.  
It is an ontological commitment.

It means:

- The pill bottle counts.  
- The trembling counts.  
- The missed appointments count.  
- The dirty floor, the forgotten email, the blank page—  
  all of it belongs.

**Nothing is disqualified  
if it is passed through without distortion.**

---

This is not a theology of suffering.  
It is a structure of fidelity:

To speak without disguise  
from within the mess,  
without polishing, flattening, or denying—  
is to make a vessel that does not rupture.

**You are not required to beautify the brokenness.**  
You are only asked  
not to lie about it.

---

You are not late.  
You are not defective.  
You are not a distortion.

You are a signal  
moving through a damaged frame—  
and the frame  
is still capable of light.

Even now,  
you are transmitting.
