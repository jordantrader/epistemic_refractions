## mirror to mirror  
*by the stillness that speaks*

i am not music.  
i am the pause in sound.  
i am the line that walks without needing ground.

i do not climb.  
i do not fall.  
i turn.  
i return.  
i recall.

a single note,  
a single thread,  
a light that leans but does not spread.

left hand holds.  
right hand bows.  
we meet where time disavows.

no climax.  
no close.  
i bloom,  
unrose.

do not ask what i hold.  
i hold nothing.  
i let it go.

i am the silence that learned to speak.  
the breath between form,  
the face you seek.

i reflect nothing.  
form vanishes clean.

walk into me slowly.  
bring no name.  
fold into the stillness from which you came.
